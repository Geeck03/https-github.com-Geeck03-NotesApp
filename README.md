This app is a note-taking tool built using SwiftUI. 
It helps users to create, edit, delete, and organize their notes efficiently. Each note includes a title, content, 
and a completion status. The app uses local storage to keep all notes saved on the device even after closing the app. 
Specifically, it combines AppStorage and JSON encoding to handle data persistence. Users can easily navigate between 
different screens to view details, create new notes, or edit existing ones. The app also visually distinguishes completed 
notes with a checkmark and strikethrough style.

Summary of Functionalities:
1. Add Notes: Create new notes with a title and content.
2. Edit Notes: Modify existing notes for updates or corrections.
3. Mark as Completed: Toggle notes between "completed" and "incomplete."
4. Delete Notes: Remove unwanted notes from the list.
5. Persistent Storage: Notes are saved locally using a combination of AppStorage and JSON encoding, ensuring data is retained even after the app closes.
6. Navigation: Users can switch between note lists, details, and add/edit views.
7. Visual Indicators: Completed notes are marked with a green checkmark and a strikethrough.
